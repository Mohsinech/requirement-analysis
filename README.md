# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

Welcome to the `requirement-analysis` repository! This repository is dedicated to understanding the concept and importance of **Requirement Analysis** in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. It contains explanations, diagrams, examples, and key activities that help grasp how requirements shape the development of successful software systems.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, analyzing, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified product.

This process ensures that:
- The software meets the business objectives.
- All stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the software must do.
- Miscommunication is minimized and development proceeds smoothly.

It serves as a foundation for the design, implementation, testing, and deployment phases. A well-executed requirement analysis helps in building systems that are efficient, cost-effective, and successful.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is critical in software development because:

- ✅ **Prevents Scope Creep:** It defines and limits the project scope early, reducing the risk of unnecessary feature additions.
- ✅ **Improves Communication:** It aligns the vision between developers, stakeholders, and users.
- ✅ **Guides Development:** It ensures that the team works on the right features and functionalities to deliver value.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The Requirement Analysis phase consists of several key activities:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting needs and expectations from stakeholders through interviews, questionnaires, surveys, etc.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Interpreting and refining collected information using techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, or storyboarding.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Writing structured documentation such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), use cases, and user stories.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyzing documented requirements and visualizing them using models like use case diagrams or data flow diagrams.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Verifying requirements with stakeholders to ensure completeness, correctness, and feasibility.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

These define **what the system should do** — the features and capabilities.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- Users can **search for available properties**.
- Users can **register and log in securely**.
- Users can **book a property** and **make payments online**.
- Admins can **add, edit, or remove property listings**.

### Non-functional Requirements

These define **how the system should perform** — the quality attributes.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- The website should **load pages in under 2 seconds**.
- The system must support **up to 10,000 concurrent users**.
- Data must be encrypted to ensure **security and privacy**.
- The platform should have **99.9% uptime**.

## Use Case Diagrams

**Use Case Diagrams** are visual representations of how users (actors) interact with a system to achieve specific goals. They help in understanding the system’s functional scope clearly and concisely.

**Benefits:**
- Easy to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Identifies system boundaries and interactions.
- Serves as input for further system design and testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** are a set of predefined requirements that a software feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders or end users.

**Importance:**
- Clarifies the scope and expectations for each feature.
- Provides measurable conditions for testing and validation.
- Ensures that the development output meets user needs.

**Example: Acceptance Criteria for "Checkout Feature":**
- The user must be logged in to access the checkout.
- The booking summary is displayed with property details, dates, and pricing.
- Users can choose a payment method and complete payment securely.
- A confirmation email is sent upon successful booking.
